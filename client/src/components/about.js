            <p className="text-left font-bold mx-4 sm:mx-8 md:mx-24">The Foundation Phase (FP) (under 11s – under 13s)</p>
            <p className="text-left mx-4 sm:mx-8 md:mx-24">
                This is the phase at which most players join our Club, during which we provide them with the building blocks for their 
                playing careers. The foundation of every young player’s development at Aryans is ball mastery. Our philosophy is focused 
                on developing key technical ball skills, creativity and spatial awareness. We work on developing decision making and 
                basic tactical awareness.<br />
                Preferred playing formations: 6v6 (1-2-2-1) 7v7 (1-2-3-1) 9v9 (1-3-3-2)

            <p className="text-left mx-4 sm:mx-8 md:mx-24">
                YDP phase provides a natural progression from the FP, with continual development of the key technical ball skills and 
                tactical knowledge already established. The emphasis on independent decision making becomes greater in the YDP along 
                with the introduction of playing positions and an increased emphasis on the player’s tactical contribution, 
                particularly at under 15’s and 16’s.<br />
                Preferred playing formations: 9v9 (1-3-3-2) 11v11 (1-4-4-2)</p>

            <p className="text-left mx-4 sm:mx-8 md:mx-24 mb-5">
                The PDP provides a natural progression from the YDP with a greater emphasis on the ability to ‘find a way to win’.
                The Professional Development phase will prepare the players technical, tactically, psychologically & physically, to 
                make the biggest step of their careers into the 1st team domain. The players will develop a bigger tactical awareness 
                playing a variety of systems.<br />

                The coaching philosophy at Aryans FC is to create a positive learning environment, while coaching within the technical
                syllabus relative to the age and ability of the players. Coaches will adopt a holistic approach whilst implementing the
                coaching program.<br />The Academy will strive to create a positive learning environment that helps develop each
                individual player across the four corners (Technically, Tactically, Physically and Psychologically/Socially).
                <br />A positive learning environment will be achieved through: Positive communication & reinforcement, building
                motivation and self-esteem, promoting values and fair play and differentiation.
